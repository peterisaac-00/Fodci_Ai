# Backend Engineering Agent

> **Current status: Phase 2.1 — LLM Provider Interface.**

Backend Engineering Agent is the foundation for a future **local, terminal-based AI agent** focused on backend engineering work. The intended product will use an interchangeable local or open-weight language-model provider rather than depend on hosted OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini APIs.

This repository includes the complete Phase 1 CLI foundation and Phase 2.1's minimal typed LLM provider boundary. At startup, `fodci` resolves `PROJECT_ROOT` or defaults to the current working directory, normalizes it to an absolute path, and validates only that the path exists and is a directory. Phase 2.1 adds no model runtime, model files, network access, or inference; the concrete local model is intentionally not implemented.

## Purpose and Long-Term Vision

The eventual agent is intended to understand a bounded software project, plan a change, read and modify code, execute commands, run tests, analyze failures, correct problems, and verify the result. Those capabilities are future work rather than promises of the current package.

```text

        ↓
Read and modify code
        ↓
Execute commands and tests
        ↓
Analyze and correct errors
        ↓
Verify result
```

## Architecture Direction

Phase 0 establishes a small set of independent boundaries. Future orchestration must depend on provider and subsystem interfaces, not a concrete model implementation.

```text

LLM Provider
 ↓
Tools
 ↓
Execution
 ↓
Evaluation
 ↓
Memory
```

The package exposes minimal typed contracts for `Agent`, `LLMProvider`, `Message`, `LLMRequest`, `LLMResponse`, `Tool`, `Memory`, and `Evaluator`. `ProviderBackedAgent` accepts an `LLMProvider` through dependency injection and delegates one request only; it does not plan, call tools, maintain memory, or run autonomously. The official `fodci` console script remains disconnected from the LLM boundary. See [the architecture notes](docs/architecture.md) for the intended dependency direction.

## Development

Use Python 3.11 or later. The project has no runtime dependencies. The official executable is `fodci`, mapped to the existing `backend_ai.cli.main:main` entry point.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Run the test suite with:

```bash
pytest
```

Verify the official console entry point after installation with:

```bash
fodci
```

The command initializes the existing application configuration and logger, resolves the project root, enters the persistent session lifecycle, and reads normal text from stdin:

```text
You > hello
Received: hello
```

Input is preserved except for the line ending added by stdin. Empty input is retained and does not terminate the session. A command is recognized only when `/` is the first character; command names are case-insensitive, while arguments remain available as text. The available local commands are:

```text
/help
/exit
```

`/help` displays the registered command list and keeps the session active. `/exit` prints `Goodbye.` and requests a clean session stop. Arguments such as `/help now` and `/exit now` return usage text without triggering command behavior. An unregistered `/status` is reported as unknown without crashing. Normal text such as `Build /api/users` is passed through unchanged. EOF and Ctrl+C terminate the session cleanly.

Check that every package module compiles with:

```bash
python -m compileall -q src
```

For the minimal runtime package installation only, use:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

## Configuration and Logging

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` only for local development. `.env` is ignored by Git. The settings abstraction recognizes `LOG_LEVEL` and `PROJECT_ROOT`, uses the current working directory when `PROJECT_ROOT` is omitted, and validates the log level. During application startup, the resolved project root must exist and be a directory; an explicitly invalid path fails clearly without falling back to the current working directory. Phase 1.7 does not inspect files inside the root. The example also documents reserved names for later stages without reading them yet.

Centralized logging is available through `backend_ai.config.configure_logging`. It applies a compact timestamped format, accepts a level, avoids global mutable application state, and does not log configuration values or secrets.

## Security Foundation

Future implementation must preserve explicit project boundaries, keep secrets out of source control and logs, treat shell execution as potentially dangerous, validate tool inputs, and avoid arbitrary filesystem access outside an explicitly authorized project root. The Phase 0 package does not yet implement a sandbox or execution system. See [security principles](docs/security.md).

| 6 | Autonomous Agent Loop |
| 7 | Testing + Self-Correction |
| 8 | Evaluation |
| 9 | Memory |
| 10 | Experience Dataset |
| 11 | Model Improvement |
| 12 | Advanced Agent |

## Non-Goals for the Current Phase

Phase 2.1 adds only the typed `LLMProvider` interface, minimal request/response/message contracts, a provider error, and a provider-injected Agent adapter. The concrete local model is intentionally not implemented in Phase 2.1. There is no model loading, inference runtime, model file, network call, prompt system, conversation loop, tool calling, planning, project analysis, file editing, terminal execution, memory, evaluation, self-learning, or autonomous behavior.
