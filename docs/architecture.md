# Architecture Direction

## Phase 0 boundary model

The first phase defines dependency boundaries without implementing agent behavior. `core.contracts` owns small shared protocols. The domain packages re-export the protocol relevant to their boundary, while future concrete implementations must live behind those contracts.

```text
Agent orchestration ──────> LLMProvider protocol
        │
        ├─────────────────> Tool protocol
        ├─────────────────> Memory protocol
        └─────────────────> Evaluator protocol

Concrete local provider / tool / store / evaluator
        └───────────────> implements its protocol
```

The dependency direction is intentional: orchestration may depend on interfaces, but it must not import a particular local model implementation. This keeps a future model provider replaceable without rewriting the agent boundary.

## Present implementation

The repository implements only these foundation pieces:

| Area | Phase 0 responsibility | Intentionally absent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Configuration | Resolve a project root and validate a log level | Agent-specific settings, secret loading, provider configuration |
| Logging | Configure the project logger safely | Runtime telemetry, log shipping, event tracing |
| Core contracts | Define typed, runtime-checkable boundaries | Concrete agents, models, tools, stores, or evaluators |
| Package layout | Reserve cohesive packages for later work | Empty placeholder implementations |

No package imports another component's future concrete implementation. Any future dependency that would create a cycle should be inverted through a contract in `core` or a deliberately owned boundary module.
